# lpsketch
LP Sketch is a web app used to create bitmaps and movies for the Launchpad Mini MK3. It was designed to make rendering still images (i.e. _**bitmaps**_) and moving images (i.e. _**movies**_) fun and easy for the Launchpad all from the comfort of the browser, without having the hassle of installing anything.

LP Sketch can connect to a Launchpad for direct control of the LEDs on its surface, allowing live previews of created bitmaps and movies (more on this below).

## Syncing with lpminimk3
LP Sketch's most important feature is its syncing ability. Using [lpminimk3](https://www.github.com/obeezzy/lpminimk3), you can control the LEDs on your Launchpad directly with the LP Sketch web interface. To enable this feature, you must:
* Install `lpminimk3`:
```bash
$ pip install lpminimk3
```
* Start `lpminimk3`'s sync server:
```bash
$ python -m lpminimk3.graphics.sync
```
* Visit the [LP Sketch](https://www.lpsketch.com) website. You should see a green indicator on the left with the word `Connected` next to it if your Launchpad is detected.
* Click an LED on the grid on the LP Sketch web interface and watch your physical Launchpad LEDs light up!

## How to use
* Connect your Launchpad to your computer.
* Visit the [LP Sketch](https://www.lpsketch.com) website.
* Ensure the indicator at the top left is green and has the `Connected` text written next to it.
* Create your bitmap or movie. You can choose between the two using the tab bar.
* Save your bitmap/movie by pressing the `Save` button.
* You can load your file using the `Load` button. Files can also be run directly using [lpminimk3](https://www.github.com/obeezzy/lpminimk3).
